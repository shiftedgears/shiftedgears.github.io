<h2>Network Printer Sharing Windows 11</h2>
<p>Firstly, I am not taking credit for this process. I just did some digging and found this in a help thread, and thought it would be good to make a copy of it so others can more easily find it.
Shout out to the Anon on the Windows support thread that laid all of this out - he's the real hero. </p>

<p>This is a guide on how to share a printer that is connected via USB over the local network to 
  other computers on the network. This guide requires sharing login credentials to another users computer, so
the proper way to do this would be to create a seperate user that explicitly is for printing that other users
can "login" as. I am not doing that in this guide because I am lazy.</p> 

<ol>
  <li>First, ensure both PCs are <bold>connected to the same netowork.</bold></li>
  <li>Set the network profile for both PCs to <bold>"Private Network."</bold></li>
  <li>Allow <bold>"File and Printer Sharing"</bold> on both PCs' Firewall settings</li>
  <li>On the Main PC, the one connected to the USB printer, open <bold>"Advanced Sharing Settings."</bold> Under
  "All Networks," enable <bold>"Password protected sharing."</bold></li>
  <li>To share the printer, on the <bold>Main PC</bold> go to Printers & Scanners > the printer > Printer Properties
   > Sharing > and tick the <bold>Share this printer</bold> option whilst giving it a discoverable name.</li>
  <li>On the <bold>Sub PC, the PC that is connecting via the network</bold>, open <bold>Credential Manager</bold> and 
  click on <bold>Windows Credentials.</bold></li>
  <li>Under Windows Credentials, click on <bold>"Add a Windows credential."</bold></li>
  <li>You will see three input fields: <bold>Internet or network address, User name, and Password.</bold>
    <ol>
      <li><bold>Internet or network address:</bold> enter the ip address or PC name of the Main PC. Ensure you use
      a double back slack before the address (\\192.168.X.X or \\DESKTOP-XXXXXXX)</li>
      <li><bold>User name:</bold> Enter the account name of the Main BC. This account must have <bold>Administrator
      Access.</bold></li>
      <li><bold>Password:</bold>Enter the password of the account name.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>On the <bold>Sub PC</bold> open the Network folder. Turn on network discovery and file sharing.</li>
  <li>Locate the Main PC's name. Double click on it, and you will see the shared printer.</li>
  <li>Right-click on that printer and click "open." The printer will be installed.</li>
</ol>
