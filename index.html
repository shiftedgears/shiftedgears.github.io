    <h1>Website of nkh</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Nicholas. I'm a Computer Science candidate coming out of <a href="https://www.viu.ca/" target="_blank">VIU</a> in 2024. My interests are whatever it is that is 
    interesting to me at the time. In a general sense however I tend to enjoy working on more low level topics. I would much rather work on the
     DB side of a website than the front end, because I would just make it look like this site. I primarily work in C/C++.
     </p>
    
    
    <h2>Projects</h2>
       
       <h3>Image Board (Tekku) </h3>
       <p>In the fourth year of my CSCI degree some colleagues (<a href="https://www.ethanposner.com/" target="_blank">Ethan Posner</a> and Spencer Muise) and myself made an online image board using html/css/PHP/minimal JS, 
       very much in the style of the Chan/Booru's of the early internet. Depending on if we are currently hosting it or not you can go to 
       it at <a href="http://tekku.site" target="_blank">tekku.site</a>. This site included full user profile support, 
       password hashing with salt+pepper, file storing, image hosting, etc. You can view the github page for it <a href="https://github.com/Enprogames/Tekku" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
       
       <h3>N Operating System (NoS) </h3>
       <p>In my spare time, studies allowing, I am working on creating my own OS to better understand what goes on in a computer at such a level. This is done by following along the YouTube series 
       by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M" target="none">Write your own Operating System.</a> You can see 
       where I'm at at <a href="https://github.com/shiftedgears/NoS/tree/main" target="none">here,</a> and see if I've worked on it
       recently or not.</p>
