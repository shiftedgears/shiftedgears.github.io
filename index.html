    <h1>Website of nkh</h1>

    <p>Hello, I'm nkh. I'm a CSCI candidate coming out of VIU in 2024. My interests are anything that's interesting to me at the time, but more specifically I enjoy working on low level topics. I would much rather work on the DB side of a website than the front end, because I would just make it look like this site. I primarily work in C++ but am nowhere near guru level.</p>
