    <h1>Website of nkh</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Nicholas. I'm a Computer Science <s>candidate</s> graduate coming out of <a href="https://www.viu.ca/" target="_blank">VIU</a> of 2024. My interests are whatever it is that I find
    interesting at the time. But, I do find networking and communications, as well as low level topics, very enjoyable to learn about and work with. I would much rather work on the DB side of a website than the 
    front end for example, because I would probably just make it look like this site. I primarily work in C/C++, although am learning and trending towards Rust, and have experience with Python.
     </p>
    
    
    <h2>Projects</h2>
       
       <h3>Image Board (Tekku) </h3>
       <p>In the fourth year of my CSCI degree some colleagues (<a href="https://www.ethanposner.com/" target="_blank">Ethan Posner</a> and Spencer Muise) and myself made an online image board using html/css/PHP/minimal JS, 
       very much in the style of the Chan/Booru's of the early internet. Depending on if we are currently hosting it or not you can go to 
       it at <a href="http://tekku.site" target="_blank">tekku.site</a>. This project included full user profile support,
       password hashing with salt+pepper, file storing, image hosting, etc. You can view the github page for it <a href="https://github.com/Enprogames/Tekku" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
       
       <h3>himark Chat</h3>
       <p>In my final year I worked on a project with <a href="https://github.com/Maughan1">Curtis Bachen</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Sharkbubble">Vladislav Mazur</a> in which we created a command line based chat application in Python. This was mainly done through Aysncio and Websockets.
       It is comprised of two seperate applications: the server and the client programs. A user runs the the server software on the computer they wish to host their server, listening on port 8000 by default.
       Another user will run the client software and attempt to connect to a server being hosted on the local machine by default. The source code for each can be tweaked to edit the port/ip. The server has a text file with a list
       of room names, and creates a room for each given name. Users can connect to different rooms and swap between rooms at any time. They can also see whoever else is in the room at any given time.
       This was made using asyncio, websockets, and textual for the great CLI. You can view the github page for it <a href="https://github.com/shiftedgears/himark" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
       
       <h3>N Operating System (NoS) <b>PAUSED</b> </h3>
       <p>In my spare time, studies allowing, I am working on creating my own OS to better understand what goes on in a computer at such a level. This is done by following along the YouTube series 
       by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M" target="none">Write your own Operating System.</a> You can see 
       where I'm at at <a href="https://github.com/shiftedgears/NoS/tree/main" target="none">here,</a> and see if I've worked on it
       recently or not.</p>

       <h3>N.E.s </h3>
       <p>Myself and (<a href="https://www.ethanposner.com/" target="_blank">Ethan Posner</a> are working on creating an NES emulator written in Rust. You can follow along <a href="https://github.com/Enprogames/NES-Emulator" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
